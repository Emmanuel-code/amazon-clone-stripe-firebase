## Usage

To run the application locally; clone the repo, install dependencies and run the app.

```
$ Create a project on firebase
$ git clone https://github.com/Emmanuel-code/amazon-clone-stripe-firebase.git
$ cd amazon-clone
$ create a file `.env.local` to store credentials from firebase or you can defaultly copy the config credentials in  the firebase file in src 
$ yarn && yarn start
```

The app starts in development mode and opens a browser window on `http://localhost:3000`. The project rebuilds and the browser reloads automatically when source files are changed. Any build or runtime errors are propagated and displayed in the browser.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
